# itinerary-challenge

Project that aims to find the best path between two cities using an 
  architecture based on microservices.

## 1 Services included

### 1.1 config-service

Configuration service. Provides the configuration needed by other services.

Configurations files are stored in `/config-data` folder.

Uses:
- Spring Cloud Config Server

### 1.2 registry-service

Eureka Server. A centralized register of available microservices. Used by several 
  components that enhance security and resilience.

Uses:
- Eureka Server

### 1.3 admin-service

Spring Boot Admin Server. Provides a dashboard to query the data exposed by Spring Boot
Actuator

Uses:
- Spring Boot Admin Server

### 1.4 gateway-service

API routing service. Provides a unique entry point to our microservice architecture.

### 1.5 itinerary-service

Itinerary service. Provides an API to manage itineraries, allowing CRUD operations.

Uses:
- Spring Cloud Config Client
- Eureka Client
- Spring Boot Actuator
- Spring Boot Admin Client

### 1.6 search-service

Search service that consumes `itinerary-service`. This service performs searches among 
  itineraries to find the best path between two given cities. It provides two different calls:
- `findByLessTime` provides all the paths between two cities, ordered by time expended 
  (independent of the departure time).
- `findByLessSteps` provides all the paths between two cities, ordered by number of itineraries
  done.

Uses:
- Spring Cloud Config Client
- Eureka Client
- Spring Boot Actuator
- Spring Boot Admin Client

## 2. Frameworks and libraries used

### 2.1 Spring Cloud Config

Spring Cloud Config provides server-side and client-side support for externalized configuration 
  in a distributed system. The server exposes an HTTP resource-based API for external 
  configuration that clients consume, centralizing management of external properties for 
  applications across all environments.

This project uses Spring Cloud Config to centralize and manage configurations trough 
  `config-service`.

### 2.2 Spring Boot Actuator

Actuator is mainly used to expose operational information about 
  the running application â€” health, metrics, info, dump, env, etc. It uses HTTP endpoints 
  or JMX beans to enable us to interact with it.

This component is a dependence of Hystrix and is necessary to deploy the monitoring
  tool `admin-service`. It exposes operational information in JSON format at:
- <http://localhost:8091/actuator> from `itinerary-service`
- <http://localhost:8092/actuator> from `search-service`

### 2.3 Spring Cloud Netflix

Project that allows Spring Boot applications to enable and configure common patterns. 

Spring Cloud Netflix is used to enable the following patterns in this application:
- Service Discovery (Eureka)
- Circuit Breaker (Hystrix)
- Client Side Load Balancing (Ribbon)

#### 2.3.1 Eureka

Also known as Discovery Server, Eureka is a lookup server. All the microservices in the
  cluster register themselves to this server.

It is used as dependency to provide circuit breaker pattern (through Hystrix) and 
  client side load balancing pattern (through Ribbon). Eureka also provides information 
  about registered instances at <http://localhost:8099/>.

#### 2.3.2 Hystrix

Enhances resilience of distributed systems providing circuit breaker pattern, monitoring
  calls between microservices to prevent cascading failures.

Hystrix is used as security component as it automatically opens circuit when reached a 
  threshold. Status can be checked through
  [Hystrix Monitor](http://localhost:8092/hystrix/monitor?stream=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A8092%2Factuator%2Fhystrix.stream%20).

### 2.4 Spring Boot Admin

Web application used for managing and monitoring Spring Boot applications. Each 
  application is considered as a client and registers to the admin server.

Used to monitor actuators endpoints in a simpler way.

### 2.5 Spring Cloud Sleuth

Spring Cloud Sleuth provides Spring Boot auto-configuration for distributed tracing.
